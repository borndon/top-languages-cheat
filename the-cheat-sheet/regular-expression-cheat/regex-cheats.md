To import Regex into your python code, kindly used

`import re`

## Functions/Methods and Keywords in Regex
- <b>search()</b>

This is like finding something and it is more powerful when you specify what you are looking.
This is the function that looks and parse through the data looking for the words intended.

- <b>findall()</b>

This is way more powerful, easier and faster than the `search` function. The findall function would not only doing the
searching only but also create an handle for the getting the output.

You might not really understand this but as we move on, you'll get to understand it better.
